Arbeitsanweisung
Due 1.11.2010
groups of two students

- setup three hosts netsec1, netsec2, netsec3 with the following network topology:
netsec1 ------ netsec2 ------ netsec3
netsec1 cannot reach netsec3 directly!

- If you use VirtualBox, import the Ubuntu Server image three times and choose “Internal Network” for the networking interface.
- netsec2 needs two interfaces
- the network interconnecting netsec1 and netsec2 has to be named differently from the network interconnection netsec2 and netsec3
- setup the IP addresses and routes, e.g. using ifconfig and route
- enable IP forwarding on netsec2
- SUBMIT the appropriate commands

- netsec1 should be able to ping netsec3 via netsec2
- on netsec3, use iptables to block ICMP traffic from netsec1
- netsec1 cannot ping netsec3 anymore
- SUBMIT the appropriate command

- on netsec2, enable NAT (either source NAT, or masquerading) for netsec1 (means: netsec1 is in the private network, netsec3 is in the public network)
- netsec1 is now able to ping netsec3 again although the rule to drop ICMP traffic from netsec1 is still active
- SUBMIT the appropriate command
